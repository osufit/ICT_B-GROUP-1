      Introduction to the Study <br>
      Coding is an essential skill in today’s technology-driven world, supporting everything from apps and AI to banking systems. As demand for coding skills grows, learning to program remains a challenge due to the complexity of translating ideas into precise instructions. Online platforms like CodeChum help simplify programming education by offering interactive lessons, hands-on exercises, and structured courses in languages like C++, Python, and Java. Designed to make coding more accessible, especially in the Philippines, CodeChum provides real-time feedback and a supportive learning environment. However, research on its effectiveness compared to traditional methods remains limited. This study explores how CodeChum impacts ICT students’ programming performance and engagement at Tapinac Senior High School, aiming to enhance programming education.
